Title: Sample Project Setup

# Sample Project Setup

Olingo has prepared a very simple sample car service that can work as a starting point for implementing a custom OData service.
This service consists of a very simple EDM with two entity sets that are cars and manufactures and a memory based data provider that is a simple hash map.
Therefore the project implements a very basic single OData processor supporting a minimal readonly scenario.
If build with Maven the build result is a web application (`war` file) which can be deployed to any JEE compliant web application server (e.g. [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org)).
