Title: Olingo OData Client for JavaScript

## Olingo OData Client for JavaScript
The Olingo OData Client for JavaScript (odatajs) is a library written in JavaScript that enables browser based frontend applications to easily use the OData protocol for communication with application servers.

This library "odatajs-4.0.0.min.js" supports only the OData V4 protocol.

For using the OData protocols V1-V3 please refer to the [datajs library](http://datajs.codeplex.com/)

The odatajs library can be included in any html page with the script tag (for example) `<script type="text/javascript" src="./sources/odatajs-4.0.0.min.js"></script>`
and its features can be used through the `odatajs` namespace (or `window.odatajs`). The odatajs library can be used together with the datajs library which uses the `window.OData` namespace.

For API documentation please see [ODatajs API documentation](/doc/javascript/apidoc/index.html)

You may also use the documentation and the samples from the [datajs library](http://datajs.codeplex.com/documentation) because the features and API are similar.
