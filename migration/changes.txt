< Before we start with the implementation, please have a look at the class `myservice.mynamespace.data.Storage`. In difference to the [navigation tutorial](http://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata4/tutorials/navigation/tutorial_navigation.html) the relations between two entities can not be hard coded because we would like to create and change relations between entities dynamically. In the constructor of the data storage the creation of the sample data is called. After that the method `linkProductsAndCategories`is called. This methods sets a few links between the just created entities. **The linked entites are stored as navigation links**

72,73c72,73
< To express the relation between two entities, Olingo uses the class [Link](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Link.html). This class is used for related entites (directly connected via Java references) and bindings (which are actually strings) to other entities. To get the related entites for a particual navigation property, you can ask an entity with the method [`getNavigationLink(String name)`](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Linked.html#getNavigationLink(java.lang.String)) for an navigation property link. The link will contain either an entity or a collection of entities dependenting on the type of the navigation property. To get the actual entities use the methods [`getInlineEntity()`](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Link.html#getInlineEntity()) or [`getInlineEntitySet()`](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Link.html#getInlineEntitySet())
< The same can be done for bindings via the method [`getNavigationBinding(String name)`](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Linked.html#getNavigationBinding(java.lang.String)). The values of the Binding can be gotten by the methods [`getBindingLink()`](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Link.html#getBindingLink()) and [`getBindingLinks()`](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Link.html#getBindingLinks()).

> To express the relation between two entities, Olingo uses the class [Link](/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Link.html). This class is used for related entites (directly connected via Java references) and bindings (which are actually strings) to other entities. To get the related entites for a particual navigation property, you can ask an entity with the method [`getNavigationLink(String name)`](/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/commons/api/data/Linked.html#getNavigationLink(java.lang.String)) for an navigation property link. The link will contain either an entity or a collection of entities dependenting on the type of the navigation property.

< The first method takes an entity-Id and returns the addressed entity. The OData objects provides a helper object to parse entity-ids. (See [UriHelper](http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata4/org/apache/olingo/server/api/uri/UriHelper.html)). After parsing the id we have to check if the addressed entity set fits to the entity set the navigation property points to. After that the data is read by calling `readEntityData`.
